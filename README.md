### Using the script

Well, after you clone the repo, **2 possibilities to run the script.**

### The easiest : 

Using Make file 
Once in the file c-environment 
You have to run this commmand :

`make build`

The file : **enumerate_numbers** has been created.
Now, to run the program you have to use this command : 

`./enumerate_numbers`

And a list of 1 to 10 should appear !
Now, to clean up the file you have to run this command : 

`make clean`

And this is over ðŸŽ‰

### The hardest : 

This is the manual execution
Once in the file **c-environment**
You have to run this command :

`./setup.sh`

When it's done run this : 

`./build_program.sh`

The file : **enumerate_numbers** has been created.
Now, to run the program you have to use this command : 

`./enumerate_numbers`
